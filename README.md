# image-generation

This CLI tool is a simple command-line interface for interacting with the OpenAI API. It was specifically created as a tool that GPTScript can leverage in order to provide the langauge with image generation capabilities.
It allows users to input a text prompt and get a response generated by OpenAI's GPT models.
Users can provide the API key directly as a command-line argument or set it through the credential tool.

## Features

- Accepts an OpenAI API key through the command line or environment variable.
- Accepts a text prompt for image generation and displays the resulting images.
- Supports image generation using a specified model, image size, quality, and the number of images to generate.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
